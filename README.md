# LearningJava
A repository to post my self studies and progress in the Java language. 

I'm aware that most of this code will be SEVERLY underdeveloped with few examples, but I'm just trying to learn the broad basics with these. 
I'll probably be making separate repositories to separate units (i.e LinkedList, Arrays, etc.), but we'll see in the future, I suppose...
